DevOps Journey

Step 1: Build Strong Foundations
Before tools, get clarity on basics:
Linux → commands, processes, services, users, permissions, logs.
Networking → DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, load balancing, firewalls.
Programming/Scripting → at least Bash and one higher-level language (Python is great for automation).
Git → version control basics (clone, commit, push, branch, merge, rebase).


Step 2: Learn Cloud Computing
Almost all DevOps roles need cloud knowledge.
Start with AWS (most in-demand).
EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling.
Alternatives: Azure or GCP (similar concepts).


Step 3: CI/CD (Core of DevOps)
Learn Jenkins (pipelines, plugins).
Explore GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
Understand concepts:
Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor.
Artifacts, stages, runners, triggers.


Step 4: Containers & Orchestration
Docker → images, containers, Dockerfile, volumes, networks.
Kubernetes → pods, deployments, services, config maps, secrets.
Learn how to deploy apps using Kubernetes.

Step 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform → provisioning infra in AWS.
Ansible / Puppet → configuration management.

Step 6: Monitoring & Logging
Tools: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack, Nagios.


Learn log collection, dashboards, alerts.
Step 7: DevSecOps & Best Practices
Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).


Secure pipelines, code scanning.


Role-based access (IAM, RBAC in Kubernetes).
Step 8: Hands-On Projects
Build a few end-to-end projects:
Deploy a simple app on AWS using Terraform + Ansible.


Create a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins/GitHub Actions.


Containerize an app with Docker & deploy on Kubernetes.


Set up monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana.
Step 9: Certifications (Optional but Helpful)
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (foundation).
AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional (advanced).


Kubernetes (CKA/CKAD).
Step 10: Apply for Roles & Keep Practicing
Start with DevOps Engineer / Cloud Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) roles.


Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.


Keep practicing automation & building side projects.
90-day DevOps Roadmap
Month 1: Foundations + Cloud + Git/GitHub
Goal: Master Linux, Git, and AWS basics.
Week 1 – Linux & Shell
Commands: file operations, permissions, processes, services.


Logs: /var/log, journalctl, systemctl.


Write 5–10 shell scripts (backup, check disk usage, monitor logs).


Week 2 – Git & GitHub
git clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, rebase.


Create a repo for notes and scripts.


Practice PR (pull request) workflow.


Week 3 & 4 – AWS Cloud
IAM, EC2, S3, VPC (public/private subnets).


RDS basics, Security Groups, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling.


Hands-on: Deploy a static website on S3 and an app on EC2 with RDS backend.


Month 2: CI/CD + Containers + Infra as Code
Goal: Learn automation and containerization.
Week 5 – CI/CD Basics
Jenkins: freestyle + pipeline jobs.


GitHub Actions: workflows, triggers.


Hands-on: Build pipeline for Java app (build → test → package → deploy).


Week 6 – Docker
Images, containers, Dockerfile, volumes, networks.


Hands-on: Containerize a simple Java/Spring Boot app.


Push image to Docker Hub.


Week 7 – Kubernetes
Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets.


Hands-on: Deploy your Dockerized app on Minikube.


Week 8 – Infrastructure as Code
Terraform basics: providers, resources, variables, outputs.


Hands-on: Provision EC2 + S3 with Terraform.


Bonus: Ansible basics (install packages, configure servers).
Month 3: Advanced DevOps + Projects + Interview Prep
Goal: Combine tools into real-world workflows.
Week 9 – Monitoring & Logging
Prometheus & Grafana basics.


ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).


Hands-on: Monitor your Kubernetes cluster.


Week 10 – DevSecOps & Best Practices
Secrets management: AWS Secrets Manager / Vault.


Security in CI/CD pipelines (SAST/DAST tools).


Role-based access (IAM + Kubernetes RBAC).


Week 11 – End-to-End Project
Build a complete CI/CD pipeline:
Code in GitHub →


CI/CD with Jenkins/GitHub Actions →


Dockerize →


Deploy on Kubernetes (EKS/Minikube) →


Infra with Terraform →


Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana.


Week 12 – Interview Prep
Revise core concepts: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, AWS.


Practice scenario-based questions (pipeline failures, scaling issues, security).


Polish resume to highlight projects + tools.
Deliverables by Day 90
